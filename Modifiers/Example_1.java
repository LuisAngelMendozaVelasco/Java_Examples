//Public class

/*The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
We divide modifiers into two groups:
    Access Modifiers - controls the access level
    Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality*/
