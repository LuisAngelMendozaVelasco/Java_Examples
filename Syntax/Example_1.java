Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
